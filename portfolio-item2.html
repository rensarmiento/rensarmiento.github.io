                <strong>Problems: </strong> <br>
                Coding: <br>
                Return to home page after checking out with paypal was not linking back to the home page. <br>
                Ran into initial issues with testing <br>
                Script wasn’t working as expected <br>
                Replication of local environment <br>
                Unrealistic/Over-optimistic planning of sprints
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Solutions: </strong> <br>
                During testing, few problems arose such as returning to the home page after checking out with paypal’s RESTful API. <br>
                During the building phase, each member was assigned a partner with a separate task. When coding errors were reported through the backlog during testing, the partner would assist in debugging the coding error. <br>
                If little progress was achieved, the problem would be addressed during the SCRUM meeting to raise awareness and address the issue as a whole. <br>
